## Java
1)Create a class called Calculator and create 3 methods ( each of the method takes 2 parameters and return int for add , float for multiply and double for divide.)- add, multiply and divide. From the main method create an instance of the class created and call the methods to perform the calculator operations.
2) Create a class CalculatorChild and extend Calculator class and override the methods in the parent class.
3) Create 3 different types of packages and add a class(along with methods with various types of access modifiers - public, private , protected) in each of them and try to create instances for these classes from the calculator class. Just observe the behavior how access specifiers work.
4) Create 3 interfaces and 1 class , try to extend interface and implement an interface.
5) Create a class and define variables(1 for each of these - class, local and static) for primitive datatypes and perform an addition operator for all combinations compatible. ( eg- add int and float , add float and double).
6) Create a class with constructor and check the different types of constructors availables.
7) Create an Enum and observe the use case for Enum type and its usage.
